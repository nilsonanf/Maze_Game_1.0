"# Maze_Game_1.0
Developed by: Nilson de Aguiar Neves Filho (started/finished: September19th, 2020/ September 20th, 2020)
This game is related to my studies of graphics and solids in OpenGL (C++). I used as base the following links: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYRrGTC7GtA&t=733s and https://youtu.be/6Miai_t_ksw
To initialize the game you have to run the "Maze_Game_1.0.exe" file, which can be found in the following path Maze_Game_1.0 > Debug > Maze_Game_1.0.exe."
